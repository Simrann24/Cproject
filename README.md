This project is implemented using C and Parsing of HTTP referred from Proxy Server.

# Building a Web Server in C
This guide will walk you through the process of building a web server using the C programming language.

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

- Basic knowledge of C programming language
- A C compiler installed on your system (e.g., GCC)
- Familiarity with socket programming concepts


## Conclusion
By following these steps, you can build a basic web server in C. Remember to handle errors and implement security measures to ensure the server's reliability and safety.

8. **Testing the web server**
    - Once you have implemented the web server, it's important to test it to ensure it functions correctly.
    - Open a web browser and enter the server's IP address and port number in the address bar.
    - Send different types of HTTP requests (e.g., GET, POST) to test the server's response.
    - Verify that the server correctly handles the requests and returns the expected responses.

9. **Deploying the web server**
    - If you want to make your web server accessible to the public, you will need to deploy it on a hosting platform or a dedicated server.
    - Choose a hosting provider or set up your own server.
    - Configure the server to run your web server application.
    - Ensure that the necessary ports are open and accessible.
    - Test the deployed web server to ensure it is functioning correctly.

10. **Further enhancements**
     - Once you have a basic web server up and running, you can explore additional features and enhancements.
     - Implement support for different HTTP methods (e.g., PUT, DELETE).
     - Add support for handling static files (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
     - Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms.
     - Optimize the server's performance and scalability.
     - Consider implementing logging and error handling mechanisms.

11. **Resources**
     - Here are some resources to further enhance your knowledge of building web servers in C:
